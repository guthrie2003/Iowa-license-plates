# Iowa-license-plates
This is a collection of Iowa License plate designs - including counties - for Tesla's latest software update.

Required: a USB device
Tesla with 2024.38 or above

Instructions:
1.  Create a folder on the root directory of the USB device name "LicensePlate", e.g. F:\LicensePlate or /mnt/usbstick/LicensePlate
2.  Copy the file(s) you want into the "LicensePlate" directory.
3.  Insert USB stick into the *glove compartment* USB drive (this is traditional USB, not the newer USB-C).
4.  On screen, just spin the visualization of your car to see the license plate on the rear. Tap that.
   
You should be able to change the characters and upload a background image from the USB drive.

Enjoy!
